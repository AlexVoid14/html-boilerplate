        <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookie Millionaire Bars</h2>
        <p>You’ve probably heard of classic Millionaire Bars, but our Chocolate Chip Cookie Millionaire Bars take them to a whole new level. Instead of the traditional crisp shortbread base, we use a chewy, buttery chocolate chip cookie dough for a comforting, familiar texture (and a super easy shortcut!).</p>
        <p>In these bars, a candy bar meets a homestyle cookie in the most decadent way. Each bite features nearly equal layers of cookie, rich caramel, and silky semisweet chocolate ganache. While you won’t get the traditional "snap" of a millionaire's shortbread, you’ll enjoy a more indulgent, tender, and satisfying treat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>baking spray flower</li>
            <li>2 (16 1/2-ounce) packages refrigerated break-and-bake chocolate chip cookie dough (such as Nestlé Toll House)</li>
            <li>2 (14-ounce) cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1 tablespoon pats, divided</li>
            <li>2 (4-ounce) bars (56% cacao) semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with baking spray; line bottom and sides with parchment paper, leaving a 1- to 2-inch overhang on long sides.</li>
            <li>Break apart dough squares along perforations and evenly scatter in bottom of the prepared pan. Let stand at room temperature until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Using a sheet of plastic wrap placed directly on surface, press dough into an even layer in the bottom of the pan. Remove and discard plastic wrap</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean or with just some moist crumbs, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack while making filling</li>
            <li>Add condensed milk, brown sugar, corn syrup, salt, and 1 cup of the butter to a large saucepan; cook over medium, whisking constantly, until butter is melted and mixture starts to bubble, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Continue to cook, whisking constantly, over medium until mixture is a caramel color, thickened, and registers 235°F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla until combined</li>
            <li>Working quickly, pour caramel over cookie layer, spreading into an even layer with a small offset spatula. Chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons butter to a medium, heatproof bowl; place bowl over  a saucepan filled with 1 inch of simmering water, making sure bottom of bowl does not touch water. Cook, stirring constantly, until chocolate mixture is melted and smooth, 2 to 3 minutes</li>
            <li>Working quickly, pour and spread chocolate mixture evenly over caramel layer. Chill in refrigerator, uncovered, until set, about 1 hour</li>
            <li>Using parchment paper as handles, remove from pan and place on a cutting board. Using a warm, dry, sharp knife, cut into bars; wipe knife clean with a damp paper towel between cuts, if desired. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 to 5 days</li>
        </ol>
